JAVASCRIPT: it is used to add functionality into webapp.
           - it is interpreted language.
           - it is loosely typed language.


-- loosely typed language means in javascript at the time of variable declartion we wont mention what type of data it contains until initialising it.


How to use JS: there are 2 ways to use JS.
  1. internal jS : in html file we use script tag and in that we write javascript code.
  2. external js : in this we create a separate js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag.


how to get output in js : 1. document.write() : it will display output in html page. it will display output in same line

"Variable : it is use to store data in it.
          - we can create variable in JS bu using var,let,constant

var : it create function scope variable.
     -we can use variable before its declaration.
     -we can re-declare variable.

let : it create block scope variable.
    - we can not use variable before declaration.
    - we can not re-declare variable.

const : it create block scope variable.(like final variable in java)
      - we can not use variable befoe its declaration.
      - in this when we declare a variable at same time we have initialize it.

 2: pop(): it removes values from last index of an array.
 3. unshift(): it use to insert values  at starting index of array.

 7.join(seperator) : it is used to convert array data into string with seperator.


 OBJECT : it is used to store multiple values with different data type.
        - in object data tstore in key amd value paired formate.
        - we can access object data outside by writing object.keyname.
